# Implementing-Logistic-Regression-with-Batch-Gradient-Descent-from-Scratch

<span style="font-size: 18px; color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">Context</span>
<p style="font-size: 15px; color: #333333;"> This repository demonstrates how to implement Logistic Regression using Batch Gradient Descent completely from scratch using Python and NumPy. The objective of this project was to gain a deep understanding of how logistic regression works internally by manually coding each step of the algorithm rather than relying on high-level libraries like scikit-learn. </p>

<span style="font-size: 18px; color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">Dataset</span>
<p style="font-size: 15px; color: #333333;"> This dataset was extracted from an exercise available in Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Specialization. The specialization is offered by Stanford Online and DeepLearning.AI through Coursera. </p>

<span style="font-size: 18px; color: #000000; font-weight: bold;">Process</span>
<p style="font-size: 15px; color: #333333;"> The code includes implementation of the sigmoid function,logistic cost function, a function to calculate the derivatives in gradient descent and a final function for batch gradient descent. The algorithm was tested on a binary classification dataset to evaluate its performance and visualize the decision boundary. </p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; color: #333333;"> The dataset and much of the inspiration for the gradient descent implementation comes from the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction" target="_blank" style="color: #0066cc; text-decoration: none;">Machine Learning Specialization</a>. This project is based on the teachings and exercises from the specializationâ€™s first course, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning" target="_blank" style="color: #0066cc; text-decoration: none;"> Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification</a>.
  
Special thanks to Andrew Ng for providing a clear and accessible introduction to core machine learning concepts.
